Just a little jar to blend acrylic paint

A few days ago I was wondering where to find a little bottle for
blending red and ocher colors to keep the new orange color aside.

Then I thought: "But I hava a 3D printer!".

So in 10 minutes I modelled this little jar, then I printed it and it worked fine.
